# Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can't go back!**

If you aren't satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you're on your own.

You don't have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn't feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn't be useful if you couldn't customize it when you are ready for it.

### Answers to Technical Questions

## 1. How long did you spend on the coding test?
I spent approximately 4 hours on the coding test, including setting up the environment, coding, and testing the application.

## 2. What was the most useful feature that was added to the latest version of your chosen language?
One of the most useful features in the latest version of JavaScript (ES6 and beyond) is the introduction of `async/await` for simplifying asynchronous code. Here’s a simple example of how `async/await` has been used:

```javascript
const fetchData = async () => {
  try {
    const response = await fetch('https://api.example.com/data');
    const data = await response.json();
    console.log(data);
  } catch (error) {
    console.error('Error fetching data:', error);
  }
};
3. How would you track down a performance issue in production? Have you ever had to do this?
To track down a performance issue in production, I would use the following approaches:

Utilize browser developer tools to identify slow-running components using the "Performance" tab.
Use monitoring tools like New Relic, Sentry, or Google Analytics to gain insights into errors and slow parts of the application.
Optimize rendering by employing React’s memo and useCallback to prevent unnecessary re-renders.
I have encountered performance issues in production before, particularly with a specific component that was rendering data inefficiently. After profiling, I optimized the rendering logic to address the bottleneck.

4. If you had more time, what additional features or improvements would you consider adding to the task management application?
If I had more time, I would consider adding:

User authentication to allow different users to manage their own tasks.
Drag-and-drop functionality for reordering tasks.
A calendar view for better visual scheduling of tasks.
Notifications for upcoming tasks.
Improved search and filter functionalities to allow for more dynamic queries.
